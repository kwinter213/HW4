How does the mux32to1by32 module work?
	The basic function of the mux is to "switch" between inputs to the final output. The address bits determine which input is being selected for output. The assignments in lines 9-41 assign the inputs to the wires. The line "assign out = mux[address];" connects the wire at the address given by address to the output.
	
How does the decoder1to32 module work?
	The decoder's function is to select one of 32 registers from a single 4 bit address. It only works when enable== 1. When enable ==1, it is shifted over to the bit of the address. For example, if enable==1, and address==3, out becomes 1000, indicating the choice of the 4th register. If enable ==0, then the output will be 0, meaning that it has selected none of the registers.
